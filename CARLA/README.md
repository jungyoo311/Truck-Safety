# NOTE:
You must install CARLA on your own before using the code provided in this dir. I will add more code as they become "complete" as an MVP.

## EECS159_automatic_control:
Uses autopilot on a given map for a vehicle (currently random picked).
- Use C to change sensor type
- use V to change sensor location

This loads a particular town into CARLA. IF you are loading Town12, be sure to uncomment the camera transform code.

## EECS159_check_maps:
This checks your directory for all maps that can be loaded.
